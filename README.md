# <Interactive Prework Study Guide Webpage for CU Irvine Coding Bootcamp>

## Description

I completed this project as part of the prework for a coding bootcamp at UC-Irvine. The website is organized by four main developer tools, "HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript." Building a simple website using these tools and about these tools was a great way to understand how all the tools work together to publish a website.
